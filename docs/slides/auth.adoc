= Authentication

== What is a authentication?

[quote, SearchSecurity]
Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what is says it is.

== How can we handle it?

* Do it yourself
* Use Django auth
* Use a 3rd party auth with Django-allauth

== DIY

* create a User model and store information about them in the DB
* store _hashed_ passwords
* need to https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/sessions/[use sessions], stored as cookies
* have to check session in view or template

== https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/[Django authentication]

* Django has built in auth, it is used in the admin interface
* It can handle: users, permissions, groups, and user sessions
* _Hashed_ passwords are stored

=== What does it look like?

* Users can be set up in the admin interface
* A login view is created
* Views are protected with decorators to redirect to the login view if needed

=== Login View

[source, python]
----
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login

def my_view(request):
    username = request.POST['username']
    password = request.POST['password']
    user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)
    if user is not None:
        login(request, user)
        # Redirect to a success page.
        ...
    else:
        # Return an 'invalid login' error message.
        ...
----

=== Protected View

[source, python]
----
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required(login_url='/accounts/login/')
def my_view(request):
    ...
----

=== Pros

* Highly customizable
* Secure by default
* Already built-in

=== Cons

* A lot left to be implemented (password resets, etc.)
* Supports authentication providers, but requires additional work

== Django-allauth

* Uses Django default authentication with common options set
* Designed to work with OAUTH workflows for common authorization servers
* Easy to set up
* Includes common ways to reset passwords, etc.

* Grants limited access to information about user accounts on another service (ie. what is your email on Facebook?)
* _Applications must be registered_
