= The Python/Django Environment

== Python

* Python is a general purpose, interpreted language
* designed to be readable, consistent, and easy to learn
* there are _a lot_ of packages available for it

== pip

* pip is the python package management system
* handles dependencies and strives to be consistent
* can install things for all users of a system _or_ just one user

== venv

* A virtual environment (the venv module is installed by default) allows you to
  create individual environments for your projects
* Each project has _exactly_ the dependencies it needs and the correct
  version numbers
* Packages do not need to be installed globally
* venv uses environment variables to get the job done

== Django

* Django is a framework for developing web applications with Python
* It lives within a project directory and a project-wide/site-wide directory
  within that
* Django apps are given their own directories

== Directory Structure

[source, text]
----
is601_example_project (Project directory)
├───is601_example_project (Django site/project-wide files)
├───is601_example_app (An app within a project)
└───virtual_env (Your virtual environment)
----

* You can use `pip freeze` to get a listing of all your project requirements
* If you save that to `requirements.txt` you could ship the whole project
  directory (without `virtual_env` to save space) and people should be able to
  recreate/run your project
