== Why are they so popular?

* It is significantly easier to ask someone to go to a website instead of
  installing an application.
* It is easier to update a web application.
* Web applications lend themselves readily to Software as a Service (SaaS)
* Web applications can do _almost_ anything; modern web browsers are more
  complex than modern operating systems.
