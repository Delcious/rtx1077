= Exercise 5

In this exercise we will be:

. Adding a new model to our app
. Adding our app to INSTALLED_APPS
. Migrating our database
. Creating a new superuser
. Adding our model to the list of models managed by the admin interface
. Adding information to the database with the admin interface

== Notes on File System Layout

Recall that our project is called `example` and our app is called `app`. This
means that you should have a directory (typically within your home directory)
called `example` and _inside_ that directory there should be a project-wide
settings directory named `example` and an individual application directory
named `app`. All paths in this tutorial assume you are in the _first_ `example`
directory.

== Adding a New Model

Model information is largely stored in individual application directories.
Recall that our application is named `app` so you would expect the model
information to be in `app/models.py`. Let's change that file to look like the
following:

.app/models.py
[source, python]
----
from django.db import models

class BakedGood(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    desc = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    good_type = models.CharField(
        max_length=2,
        choices=[
            ('BG',"Bagel"),
            ('BR',"Bread"),
            ('CO',"Cookie"),
            ('CA',"CAKE"),
            ('PR',"PRETZEL")
        ]
    )
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    recipe = models.TextField()
----

== Add our App to INSTALLED_APPS

Currently Django does not know much about the existence of our application and
it will not create migrations for it. To fix that we need to _add_ our
application to the project-wide INSTALLED_APPS list. Recall that project-wide
information is stored in the `example` directory (the name of our project).
Let's _add_ our example app to the list in `example/settings.py`:

WARNING: Do not edit/delete the entire file, you're changing a _section_ of
this file as specified below.

.example/settings.py (excerpted)
[source, python]
----
... <1>
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'app.apps.AppConfig',
]
... <1>
----
<1> These elipses signify that there is more file above and below this edit,
    which we are not changing.

== Migrating

Now we need to create a migration and migrate, you can do that with the
following commands:

[source, console]
----
PS C:\Users\rxt1077\example> py -3 manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'app':
  app\migrations\0001_initial.py
    - Create model BakedGood
PS C:\Users\rxt1077\example> py -3 manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, app, auth, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
  Applying admin.0003_logentry_add_action_flag_choices... OK
  Applying app.0001_initial... OK
  Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
  Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
  Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
  Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
  Applying auth.0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages... OK
  Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0009_alter_user_last_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0010_alter_group_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions... OK
  Applying auth.0012_alter_user_first_name_max_length... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
----

== Creating a New Superuser

WARNING: Before you run this, clear make sure you've cleared up any pending
migrations for your site. You can run `py -3 manage.py migrate` to be sure.

The following command will guide you through creating a new Django superuser:

[source, console]
----
PS C:\Users\rxt1077\example> py -3 manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'rxt1077'): IS601
Email address: IS601@IS601.com
Password:
Password (again):
The password is too similar to the username.
This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.
Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]: y
Superuser created successfully.
----

WARNING: You're characters won't be echoed as you create the password. Don't be
alarmed, they are still recorded.

NOTE: Feel free to make the user name/email/password anything you can remember.
You may be prompted to bypass the in-built security checks, as seen above, if it
is too simple.

== Add a Model to the Admin Interface

In order for the admin interface to allow us to edit our new model, we need to
create an `admin.py` file that tells it about it. Let's change the
`app/admin.py` file to look like the following:

.app/admin.py
[source, python]
----
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import BakedGood

admin.site.register(BakedGood)
----

== Adding Information to the Database

Now you should be able to run `py -3 manage.py runserver` and open
http://localhost:8000/admin in a web browser. Sign in with the user
name/password _you_ created and take a moment to explore the interface. Add
three BakedGoods to the database (choose whatever options you like) and then
take a screen shot showing that there are three items in the table.
