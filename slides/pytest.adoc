== Testing

* You may have noticed that I wrote a script to grade last week's exercise
* Automated testing is common in Python
* pytest is a framework that makes it easy to write small, readable tests
* pytest is a Python package and can be installed with PIP (`pip install pytest`)

== Types of Tests

Unit Test:: Tests a piece of the application like a function.
Integration Test:: Tests to see that the units work together to meet the expected result.

== Coverage

* what percentage of application code is tested
* Example: If you have twenty lines of code and ten of them are tested your coverage is 50%
* coverage can be a good metric to see if you're writing enough tests

== Pytest

* runs functions or files that start with `test_`
* uses `assert` statements to test if things are working
* keeps track of passed/failed tests
* can be run with the `pytest` command
