== Lambda

* Python supports anonymous functions through the `lambda` keyword
* Python's first-class functions mean you can pass functions as arguments
* Sometimes this can make your life a little bit easier
* Fun Fact: The lambda keyword is named after Lambda Calculus which was invented by Alonzo Church in Princeton NJ in 1936!

=== sorted

[source,python]
----
list_of_dicts = [
    {'student_id': 8675309, 'grade': 80},
    {'student_id': 8770909, 'grade': 70},
    {'student_id': 8553210, 'grade': 60},
]

by_grade = sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda element: element['grade'])
----

* built-in function that returns a new sorted list
* has an optional argument `key` which specifies a function used to extract a comparison key from each element 

== Sets

* a type for when you need multiple things with no duplicates
* does _not_ preserve order
* items must be _hashable_ (no dicts)
* uses curly braces: `{}` (like dicts)
* you can add and remove items but can't change an item in a set
* supports intersection, `&`, union, `|`, and difference, `-`

== Set Example

[source,python]
----
set_1 = {0, 2, 4, 6}
set_2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

set_1.add(8)
print(set_1)

set_1.add(8)
print(set_1)

set_1.remove(8)
print(set_1)

print(set_1 & set_2)
print(set_1 | set_2)
print(set_2 - set 1)
----

IMPORTANT: Try this in interactive Python. What does each print statement print?

== Tuples

* built-in data type for storing collections of data
* not used nearly as much as Lists or Dictionaries, but still worth knowing
* uses parentheses
* ordered, unchangeable, and allows duplicates

== Tuple Example

[source,python]
----
my_tuple = ("abc", 1, "def", 2)

print(my_tuple[3])

one_item_tuple = ("abc",)
----

IMPORTANT: Try this out in interactive Python. What does it print? Why do you need to trailing comma for a tuple with one item? What type do you get if you leave it off?

== Casting

[source,python]
----
user_input = input()
my_number = int(user_input)
----

* occasionally you may want to force something to have a type
* you can do this with the above syntax
* if an exception is a possiblity (such as `ValueError`), use `try/except` statements

== Optional Typing

[source,python]
----
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello ' + name
----

* https://mypy-lang.org/[mypy] is an optional static type checker for Python
* you use it the same way you use linters
* https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/[PEP 484] - describes how type hints can be put in Python

IMPORTANT: What type of errors could you avoid by using typed Python?

== Dates

=== Python Datetime

* Python includes classes for amniuplating dates and times in the `datetime` module
* Traditionally Python has had issues with timezones (prompting Django to develop their own Date objects)
* I advise you to stick to UTC as much as possible
* Timestamps from the UNIX tradition sometimes use a monotonic clock counting seconds since the UNIX _epoch_: January 1st, 1970

=== Datetime Examples

[source,python]
----
from datetime import datetime
import time

todays_date = datetime.now()
date_string = todays_date.isoformat()
timestamp = time.time()
also_todays_date = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)
----

IMPORTANT: In an interactive Python shell try running the above code. What does ISO format look like? What does a timestamp look like?
