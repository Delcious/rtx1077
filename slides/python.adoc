The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

== Usage

* Currently the second most popular programming language
* https://info.hackerrank.com/rs/487-WAY-049/images/HackerRank-2020-Developer-Skills-Report.pdf[Over 50% of hiring managers seeking candidates who know the language]
* Used in backend development, data science, app development, and IT ops
* Often recommended for beginners, but used by almost everyone

== Installing Python

* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Download the latest version of Python here]

IMPORTANT: Download and install Python now. This is your opportunity to troubleshoot installation issues as a class. After this slide, it's assumed that you have the latest version of Python installed.

== print()

[source,python]
----
print("Hello world")
----

* Outputs a message or object to the standard out
* This program would print out `Hello world` (with a newline)

== input()

[source,python]
----
user_input = input()
----

* Reads input from the standard input device
* Results are typically stored in a _variable_
* Here we create a variable with the assignment operator, `=`
* This program would store whatever the user types (up to a newline) in `user_input`

== Interactive Mode

* If you just run the Python launcher, `py` from a terminal it will put you in interactive mode
* You can tell you're in interactive mode by the prompt: `>>>`

IMPORTANT: Open a terminal, run `py`, and get to the interactive Python prompt. Write a program that prints "Hello world". Write a program that accepts user input and stores it in a variable called `user_input`.

[.columns]
== Indentation

[.column.shrink]
* Python uses indentation (white space: tabs, spaces) to break code into blocks
* If you're not careful/consistent it will not be able to interpret your program
* The _best_ way to avoid problems is to use an editor _meant_ for editing code, such as VSCode

[.column]
image::indentation.png[]

== Syntax

[.shrink]
* Most programs are too complex to type in at the interactive prompt
* It's more common to create `.py` files containing Python code
* These files can be run with the `py` launcher
* A typical file has one statement per line
* Everything that follows a `#` on a line is ignored by Python
* `#` is used for _comments_
* Indentation must be consistent
* A colon, `:`, is used to indicate that the following indented block applies to that statement

== Variables

* A variable is a place store a value
* Variables can change (they are mutable)
* Python _does not_ require you to declare variables
* Python has _conventions_ for variable naming

== Types

* Python has some basic types, `str`, `int`, `float`, `list`, `dict`, etc.
* Variables technically types but they can be coerced via duck typing
* You can find a variable's type with the `type()` function and you can cast variables to a certain type: `int(my_variable)`
* Python also supports type hints which can be enforced with third party tools

== Conditionals

[source,python]
----
user_input = input()
if user_input == "Hello world": <1> <2>
    print("User input is Hello world") <3>
else:
    print("User input IS NOT Hello world")
----
<1> What does the `==` do here? Why not `=`?
<2> What does the `:` do here?
<3> Why is this section indented?

IMPORTANT: Use interactive Python to find out what type `input()` returns.

== Loops

[source,python]
----
i = 0 <1>
while i < 10: <2>
    print("i is now ", i) <3>
    i += 1 <4>
----
<1> What type is `i`?
<2> Why is there a colon here?
<3> What happens if you pass a variable to print()?
<4> What does the `+=` operator do?

== Problem Solving in Steps

image::smash.jpg[]

* Break big problems into little ones
* Make little problems into steps
* Follow steps to reach a solution
* Keep this in mind _before_ you start coding

[.columns]
== Example 1

[.column]
Print the numbers from one to five

[.column]
. Set a variable to one
. Print that variable
. Increment that variable
. Keep doing that until we reach five

=== Example 1 (continued)

[source,python]
----
counter = 1
while counter < 6: <1>
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
----
<1> Why 6? I thought we were counting to 5.

=== Note

* Python has _many_ ways to do this
* As you learn what's available you may solve this a different way

== Example 2

Read user input and print `Good job` if the input is `Hello world`

IMPORTANT: Write down the steps you would use to solve this problem.

=== Example 2 (continued)

[source,python]
----
user_input = input()
if user_input == "Hello world":
    print("Good job") <1>
----
<1> Why no else?

== Example 3

Count how many tries it takes the user to type in `Hello world` and print out that number and quit when they get it right.

IMPORTANT: Write down how you would solve this problem.

=== Example 3 (continued)

[plantuml,target=flowchart.svg,format=svg]
....
@startuml
start
:set counter to zero;
:read input;
while (input is //not// "Hello world"?) is (yes)
  :increment counter;
  :read input;
endwhile (no)
:print counter;
stop
....

=== Example 3 (continued)

[source,python]
----
tries = 0
user_input = input() <1> 
while user_input != "Hello world":
    tries += 1
    user_input = input() <1>
print(tries)
----
<1> Why do we have `input()` twice in our code?

== Installing VSCode

* VSCode is a cross-platform, free (as in cost), integrated development environment (IDE)
* It helps us manage files, run terminal commands, and create Python code all in one place
* https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[The installer for VSCode can be found here]

IMPORTANT: Download and install VSCode now. This is your chance to solve installation issues as a class. From this slide on, it's assumed that you have VSCode installed and working.

== Writing a Python Script in VSCode

* Files can be made with File->New File. VSCode will ask you to enter the file name so it knows what syntax highlighting to use.
* You can open a new terminal with Terminal->New Terminal. By default it will start at the bottom of the screen.

IMPORTANT: Make a file called <FirstName>_<LastName>.py (where <FirstName> is your first name and <LastName> is your last name) and put the code from _Example 3_ in there. Run it from the terminal by entering `py <FirstName>_<LastName>.py`.
