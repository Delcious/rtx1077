= File Operations

image::file.png[width=50%]

== `open()`

* file operations in Python start with `open()`
* the open function takes a _filename_ and a _mode_

=== Modes

[.shrink]
[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
|Flag|Name|Description

|"r"|Read|Opens a file for reading, error if it does not exist
|"a"|Append|Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
|"w"|Write|Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
|"x"|Create|Creates the file, error if it already exists
|"t"|Text|Text mode (default)
|"b"|Binary|Binary mode

|===

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
file_object = open('workfile.txt', 'w')
file_object = open('workfile.txt', 'wt')
file_object = open('image.jpg', 'b')
----

== `read()`

* a method of a file object
* calling it without any arguments will read the whole file
* you can also specify how many characters you want to read in the argument

== `readline()`

* another file object method that reads one line at a time
* call it multiple times to read multiple lines

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
file_object = open('workfile.txt', 'r')
print(file_object.read()) <1>
file_object.close()

file_object = open('workfile.txt', 'r')
print(file_object.read(10)) <2>
file_object.close()

file_object = open('workfile.txt', 'r')
print(file_object.readline()) <3>
file_object.close()

file_object = open('workfile.txt', 'r')
for line in file_object: <4>
    print(line)
file_object.close()
----
<1> prints _all_ of the file
<2> prints the first 10 characters of the file
<3> prints the first line of the file
<4> iterates through the file, printing _lines_ one-by-one

== `with`

[source,python]
----
with open('workfile.txt', 'r') as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        print(line)
----

* Notice how we had to close the file at the end in the examples?
* We can use a `with` statement to make sure we don't forget to close the file
* This will automatically close the file when we leave the `with` block

== `write()`

[source,python]
----
with open('workfile.txt', 'w') as file_object:
    file_object.write("This line will replace the content in the file")
----

* The `write()` member allows you to write to a file
* Depending on the mode ("a", "w", "x"), the contents will be overwritten or appended to

== File Helpers in the `os` Module

[source,python]
----
import os

os.remove('workfile.txt') <1>

if os.path.exists('workfile2.txt'): <2>
    print("The second file still exists")

os.mkdir('work_folder') <3>
os.rmdir('work_folder') <4>
----
<1> remove a file
<2> check if a file exists
<3> make a directory
<4> remove a directory
