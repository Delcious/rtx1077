= Elements of Pythonic Style

== The Importance of Style

* Because Python supports so many different ways of doing things, developers try to enforce a particular style
* You may hear something called _pythonic_ or _idiomatic_, basically meaning the way things are usually done in Python
* We touched on https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/[PEP 8] earlier, but now we'll go into more practical detail

== Write for Humans

[source,python]
----
value1, value2, value3 = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]

my_list = [name.title() for name in ['billy', 'terrance', 'divesh', 'Monica']]`

for i, item in my_list.enumerate():
    print(f"Item number {i} is {item}")

merged_dict = my_dict1 | my_dict2
----

* Code is read more than it's written
* multiple assignments, list comprehensions, `enumerate()`, and the union operator
* list comprehensions

== Test things Interactively

* One of the advantages of an interpreted language is that you can run it interactively
* Get used to importing your code a trying things out

IMPORTANT: Use the Python interactive mode to examine what the union operator on the previous slide does. Create two dictionaries and see what the result of a union between the two of them is.

== Linters and Formatters

* Since there's a modern emphasis on automation, why not automate style?
* That's exactly what these next tools do.

== Pylint

(venv) PS C:\Users\rxt1077\is601\exercise_1> pylint .\exercise_1.py
************* Module exercise_1
exercise_1.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
exercise_1.py:6:0: C0103: Constant name "attempts" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
exercise_1.py:9:4: R1723: Unnecessary "else" after "break", remove the "else" and de-indent the code inside it (no-else-break)

-----------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 7.00/10
----

* Static code analyser
* `pip install pylint`
* Checks for errors, enforces coding standards, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored

== [.hidden]#Black#

image::black.png[width=50%]

* “Any color the customer wants, as long as it’s black.” --Henry Ford
* Uncompromising code formatter
* `pip install black`
* Automatically reformats your code, no questions asked (and no compromises possible)

== Project Structure

[.shrink]
* Typically the whole project is one git repo.
* Make a `README.md` file. Everyone has opinions on text formats, but https://www.markdownguide.org/[Markdown] seems to have one the day. GitHub will render this when someone views your repo.
* If you're working in a virtual environment, `pip freeze` will provide output to make a `requirements.txt` file. This will allow anyone who has cloned your repo to get started easily (`pip -r requirements.txt`).
* A `pyproject.toml` file can be used create a Python package
* A `.gitignore` file can be useful for excluding your virtual environment and byte-compiled Python
