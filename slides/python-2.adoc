= Even More Python

image::python_meme.jpg[width=33%]

== Conventions

* Because Python is so loosely defined, it has a lot of _conventions_ to make things more consistent
* Following these conventions makes code readable and debuggable
* Many of these conventions are found in the https://peps.python.org[Python Enhanced Proposals (PEPs)]
* Most of the following advice can be found in https://peps.python.org/pep-0008[PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code]

=== Layout

* Use spaces, not tabs. Your editor should handle this for you
* Limit lines to 79 characters
* Avoid too much whitespace

=== String Quotes

* Single-quotes and double-quotes are the same in Python
* Pick a rule and stick to it
* My rule is, "double quotes if a user will see the text, otherwise single"

=== Trailing Commas

[source,python]
----
my_list = [
    "one string",
    "two string",
    "red string",
    "blue string",
    ]
----

* Some types use commas to separate elements
* Sometimes these elements are on multiple lines
* Adding a comma at the end prevents errors when you add more things

=== Naming

* variables have snake_case names: `this_is_a_variable`
* classes use CapWords names: `ThisIsAClass`
* constants (which really don't exist in Python) use all caps: `THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT` 
* functions use snake_case: `this_is_a_function()`

== Lists

[source,Python]
----
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
----

* Lists are used to store multiple things in a single variable
* They use square brackets
* Lists preserve order and can have different data types

=== Lists (continued)

[source,Python]
----
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
print(len(my_list))
print(my_list[0])
print(my_list[1])
print(my_list[2])
----

* List length can be found with the `len()` function
* Lists can be indexed with square brackets `[]`

IMPORTANT: Open Python in interactive mode and type in the above statements. What output do you get?

== Dictionaries

[source,Python]
----
my_dict = {
  'name': "Ryan",
  'born': 1981,
  'fav_color': "orange",
}
----

* uses curly brackets and stores data in key:value pairs
* can't use the same key twice
* can reference data by key with square brackets: `my_dict['name']`

== Iteration

[source,Python]
----
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
----

* Now that we have Lists and Dictionaries it can be helpful to be able to go through each of the items
* A `for` loop allows you to do exactly that

IMPORTANT: Open Python in interactive mode and run the above statements. What output do you get?

=== range()

[source,python]
----
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)
----

* sometimes you want something to iterate over a range of numbers
* `range()` does this for you
* the first argument is where to start (inclusive)
* the last argument is where to end (exclusive)

=== Iterating over a Dictionary

[source,python]
----
my_dict = {
  'name': "Ryan",
  'born': 1981,
  'fav_color': "orange",
}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
----

* sometimes you want to iterate over a dictionary
* in this case the `items()` method of a dictionary is your friend 

== Strings

* we've already used them, but things in single or double-quotes are strings
* a string can be indexed like a list: `my_string[0]`
* you can iterate through characters in a string with a for loop: `for character in my_string:`

=== Multiline Strings

[source,python]
----
"""
You can use multiple lines for strings
if you start with three single or double-quotes
"""
----

=== Docstrings

[source,python]
----
def a_function():
"""An example function"""
----

* You may see strings as the first statement in a module, function, class or method.
* These are Docstrings and they're used to document the code.
* Their usage is detailed in https://peps.python.org/pep-0257[PEP-257]

=== Format Strings

[source,python]
----
variable_1 = "Ryan"
variable_2 = 1981
format_string = f"My name is {variable_1} and I was born in {variable_2}."
print(format_string)
----

* A string that has an `f` before the first quote is a format string
* It allows you to subsitute variables _into_ the string

IMPORTANT: Open Python in interactive mode and create a variable with your name and the year you were born. Use a format string to make a string that states your name an age and then print it out to make sure it worked.

== Functions

[source,python]
----
def my_function(x, y): <1> <2> <3>
    print(f"The arguments are {x} and {y}")
    return x + y <4>
----
<1> The `def` keyword defines a function
<2> This function takes two arguments and puts them in the variables `x` and `y`
<3> The `:` means the next indented area is our function code
<4> A return statement give the result back to whatever called the function

=== Functions (continued)

* Functions are useful when you need to do something over and over again
* You can return more than one thing in a dictionary
* Functions are typically defined _before_ they are called

=== Calling Functions

[source,python]
----
def my_function(x, y):
    print(f"The arguments are {x} and {y}")
    return x + y

print(my_function(1, 2)) <1>
----
<1> The function is called here

== Modules

* A Python module is code that you can load from another Python script
* To make a Python module, just save a file with the `.py` extension
* To use a Python module, use the `import` statement

[.columns]
=== Modules Example

[.column]
--
.my_module.py
[source,python]
----
def my_function(x, y):
    return x + y
----
--

[.column]
--
.using_a_module.py
[source,python]
----
import my_module

print(my_module.my_function(1, 2))
----
--

=== Modules Practice

IMPORTANT: Using VSCode create a Python module with a function. Use Python in interactive mode to import your Python module and run the function.

== Packages

* Python packages are distributions of modules that anyone can use
* The Python package manager, PIP, can be used to install packages
* Once you have a package installed, the import statement can be used to use its module

=== Using PIP

[.shrink]
* Packages can be installed with the `pip install` command (or `py -m pip install` if `pip` isn't in your PATH on Windows)
* Packages can be uninstalled with the `pip uninstall` command (or `py -m pip uninstall`)
* Packages installed this way will be available to all your Python scripts
* Unfortunately different scripts may call for different versions of packages
* This can get out of hand _quickly_
* So what do we do?

[.columns]
== Virtual Environments

[.column]
image::venv.webp[link=https://medium.com/@TejasEkawade/installing-python-virtual-environments-cb865c3147a7]

[.column.shrink]
* Virtual environments can have individual versions of packages and the Python interpreter itself
* In this way each app can have it's own, individual dependency packages
* The venv module (built in) supports creating virtual environments
* `py -m venv venv` would create a virtual environment in the current directory with the name `venv`

=== Activating Virtual Environments

* Once you have a virtual environment, you need to activate it before you can use it
* In Windows this is done via the `venv/Scripts/activate` command
* From then on any packages you install will be installed in the virtual environment

IMPORTANT: In a terminal, create a new directory and make a virtual environment inside it. Activate the virtual environment. How do you know it's active? Install the `pytest` package. How do you know it's installed?
