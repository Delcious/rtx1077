= Exercise 1

Write a Python script that gives a user up to three attempts to input the phrase "Hello world".
If the phrase is input correctly, print "Good job" and end the program.
Each time the phrase is input incorrectly, print "Please try again".
After three incorrect attempts print "Attempts exceeded" and end the program.

Submit your Python script for this assignment with the filename <FirstName_LastName>.py, where <FirstName> is your first name and <LastName> is your last name
Remember, this will be automatically tested so capitalization, punctuation, and spelling matters!

In case you're curious, here's the Python script that will be used to test your program:
