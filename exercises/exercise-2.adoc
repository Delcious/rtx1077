= Exercise 2

For this exercise, clone https://github.com/rxt1077/is601[the class git repo] to a folder on your local machine that you can find easily.
Open the repo using VSCode so you can see the file tree on the left, a terminal on the bottom, and the files you are editing tabbed in the main view.
This will be the our standard setup for completing exercises in this class.

In the _exercise_2_ folder you will find a test file for this exercise.
Inside this folder, create a virtual environment, activate it, and install _pytest_.
It is your job to create a file named _count_caps.py_ that has a function named `count_caps()` which takes a single argument, a sentence, and counts the number of capitalized words in the sentence.
Your function should return that number.

You can test whether or not your code is working by running `pytest`.
Once you have your code working, submit your Python file (_count_caps.py_) via Canvas.
It will be graded using the same tests.
