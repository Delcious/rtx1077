= Exercise 4

In the _exercise_4_ directory, create a file named _triangle.py_ that can pass the tests in _test_triangle.py_.

This description is purposefully vague as part of the exercise is to see if you can read and interpret pytest tests.
One of the tests will also require you to https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-str-repr-functions[learn about the `\__str__()` method for Python classes].

Submit the _triangle.py_ file that you create.
